Welcome to my repository for PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab exercises on Broken Access Control vulnerabilities. This repository contains solutions, notes, and resources related to various labs that demonstrate and exploit access control vulnerabilities.

To replicate the lab environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a PortSwigger Account:**
   - Visit [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) and create an account.

2. **Access the Labs:**
   - Navigate to the "Lab" section and select the Access Control category. Broken access control vulnerabilities occur when an application does not properly enforce authorization mechanisms, allowing users to gain access to resources and functionalities they should not have access to. This can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, data modification, or other malicious actions.

In this repository, you will find detailed solutions and explanations for each lab exercise, demonstrating various access control issues and how to exploit them.
